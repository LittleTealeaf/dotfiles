# TODO

Yet another rewrite of plugins / setup, use features like init functions and such:


```lua
{
    "cshuaimin/ssr.nvim",
    -- init is always executed during startup, but doesn't load the plugin yet.
    init = function()
      vim.keymap.set({ "n", "x" }, "<leader>cR", function()
        -- this require will automatically load the plugin
        require("ssr").open()
      end, { desc = "Structural Replace" })
    end,
  },
```
