# TODO

- Change kitty.conf to use the "include other.conf" to use this configuration.
- Dive deeper into making ivy the default view for telescope
- Add custom VSCode integration (only load plugins used, and have a separate config for when vscode is being run with the neovim plugin)
- Organize Telescope Extensions to load only when that plugin is loaded
